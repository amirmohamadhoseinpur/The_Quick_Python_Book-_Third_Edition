'''LAB 9: USEFUL FUNCTIONS Looking back at the labs in chapters 6 and 7, refac-
tor that code into functions for cleaning and processing the data. The goal
should be that most of the logic is moved into functions. Use your own judg-
ment as to the types of functions and parameters, but keep in mind that func-
tions should do just one thing, and they shouldnâ€™t have any side effects that
carry over outside the function.'''
